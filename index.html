                            The man turned to Paul with the friendliest of smiles and said, "My boy's just turned eighteen, Doctor."
                            <br><br>
                            "That's nice."
                            <br><br>
                            "He's got his whole life ahead of him. Wonderful age, eighteen." He paused, as though his remark demanded a response.
                            <br><br>
                            "I'd like to be eighteen again," said Paul lamely.
                            <br><br>
                            "He's a good boy, Doctor. He isn't what you'd call real bright. Like his old man -- his heart's in the right place, and he wants to do the most he can with what he's got." Again the waitful pause.
                            <br><br>
                            "That's all any of us can do," said Paul.
                            <br><br>
                            "Well, as long as such a smart man as you is here, maybe I could get you to give me some advice for the boy. He just finished his National General Classification TestsHe didn't do nearly well enough for college. There were only twenty-seven openings, and six hundred kids trying for them. I can't afford to send him to a private school, so now he's got to decide what he's going to do with his life, Doctor: what's it going to be, the Army or the Reeks and Wrecks?"
                           "I suppose there's a lot to be said for both," said Paul uncomfortably. "I really don't know much about either one.  "Doctor," said the man, desperately now, "isn't there something the boy could do at the Works? He's awfully clever with his hands. Isn't there someplace in the plant--?"
                           <br><br>
                            "He's got to have a graduate degree," said Paul. He reddened. "That's policy, and I didn't make it. Sometimes we get Reconstruction and Reclamation people over to help put in big machines or do a heavy repair job, but not very often. Maybe he could open a repair shop."
                            <br><br>
                            The man exhaled."Repair shop. How many repair shops you think the city  can support, eh? I was going to open one when I got laid off. So was Joe, so was Sam, so was Alf. We're all clever with our hands, so we'll all open repair shops.
